The story of Icarus: Ancient Greek mythology, 
Master craftsmen Daedalus helped create the Minotaur which greatly angered 
the king of Crete, the king forced Daedalus to build an inescapable labyrinth 
for the minotaur under the castle and then imprisoned Daedalus and his son 
Icarus for life, in the tallest tower on Crete, but Daedalus was a master 
craftsmen, so he fastened two pairs of wings from the wax of candles and the 
feathers of birds that flocked on the tower, before Daedadus and Icarus jumped 
the father Daedalus warned his son icarus that flying too close to the water 
would dampen the wings and they would not function, flying too close to the 
sun would melt the wax and the wings would come apart, Daedalus told his son 
flying too low or too high meant certain death and they both must stick to the 
middle path, they jumped and were not flying the middle path for long when 
Icarus began to climb higher and higher, he was overwhelmed with the ecstasy of 
flight, he was overcome with the feeling of divine power, he felt like a god, 
he flew higher and higher, Daedalus was powerless to stop him, soon the sun 
melted the wax of Icarus' wings and he plummeted to his death.
